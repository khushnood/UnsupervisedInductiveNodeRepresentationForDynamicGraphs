# UnsupervisedInductiveNodeRepresentationForDynamicGraphs
In this project we have given framework for unsupervised learning for dynamic graphs as well as generating node embedding inductively for other snapshots of the graphs.
**
Unsupervised learning for inductive node embedding generation for dynamic graphs
**. 

Please extract the files keep *unsupervisedInductiveNodeRepresentationGenrationForDynamicGraphs* and *data* direcorty under same parent directory, and run the main_*.py. To use your own data see the src/loader/dataset_loader.py and make changes accordingly.
